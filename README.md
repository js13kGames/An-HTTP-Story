## Credits üôè

A huge thank you to...

- [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/) for the spark of inspiration.
- [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) for the game engine, detailed
  documentation, and absurdly useful code sandbox.
- [SoundBox](https://sb.bitsnbites.eu/) for the tiny music player.
- [m@Bits'n'Bytes](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=64246) for the epic
  sountrack _Wilderness_.
- [zzFX](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/) for sound effects.

And [the hard-working many](https://xkcd.com/2347/) who maintain all the open
technologies we take for granted.
